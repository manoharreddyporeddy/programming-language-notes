Java SE7 Fundamentals 
Duration: 5 Days 
What you will learn 
	This Java SE 7 Fundamentals training teaches students with little or no programming experience to begin to learn 
	programming using the Java programming language. It explores the significance of object-oriented programming, the 
	keywords and constructs of the Java programming language and the steps required to create simple Java technology 
	programs. 
Learn To: 
	Use various Java programming language constructs to create several Java technology applications. 
	Use decision and looping constructs and methods to dictate program flow. 
	Perform basic error handling for your Java technology programs. 
	Implement intermediate Java programming and object-oriented (OO) concepts in Java technology programs. 
	Demonstrate knowledge of Java technology and the Java programming language. 
Benefits to You 
	By investing in this course, you'll develop a solid foundation in the Java programming language upon which to base 
	continued work and training. It features the Java Platform, Standard Edition 7 (Java SE 7), and uses the Java SE 
	Development Kit 7 (JDK 7) product. 

	Participate in Hands-On Exercises 

	You'll gain hands on experience with basic object oriented concepts like inheritance, encapsulation and abstraction. 
	Learn to create and use simple Java classes containing arrays, loops and conditional constructs. 

	Dive into Real World Applications 

	You'll also learn how to use and manipulate object references, as well as write simple error handling code. This course 
	helps you develop a solid understanding of what the Java SE7 platform is and how it's used in real world applications.

Topics 2

Assume the following:
Missing package and import statements: If sample code do not include package or import statements, and the question does not explicitly refer to these missing statements, then assume that all sample code is in the same package, or import statements exist to support them.
No file or directory path names for classes: If a question does not state the file names or directory locations of classes, then assume one of the following, whichever will enable the code to compile and run:
  ? All classes are in one file
  ? Each class is contained in a separate file, and all files are in one directory
Unintended line breaks: Sample code might have unintended line breaks. If you see a line of code that looks like it has wrapped, and this creates a situation where the wrapping is significant (for example, a quoted String literal has wrapped), assume that the wrapping is an extension of the same line, and the line does not contain a hard carriage return that would cause a compilation failure.
Code fragments: A code fragment is a small section of source code that is presented without its context. Assume that all necessary supporting code exists and that the supporting environment fully supports the correct compilation and execution of the code shown and its omitted environment.
Descriptive comments: Take descriptive comments, such as "setter and getters go here," at face value. Assume that correct code exists, compiles, and runs successfully to create the described effect.
